# Portfolio-01-Rock-Paper-Scissors

This is a browser game based on Rock, Paper, Scissors. 

This project consists of html, css, and JS.

Minimal HTML was implemented in order to focus on DOM manipulation with JS.

This project also focuses on the use of modular JS to operate, with each function being stored in its own module file.

The project utilizes webpack to bundle the modules.

Key Functions involved include:
1) a self-invoking function to automatically build the game board upon launch
2) a consistently updating DOM to notify play choice, computer choice, score, and outcome
3) creation of two different UI (the game and the game over pages)
4) simulation of an opponent player
5) simple implementation of JS objects to store game rules, emojis, and scores
6) checks on the winner of the round and if there is a winner of the overall game
